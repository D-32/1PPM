An easy to use UIAlertController builder for swift

## Features
* Short and simple syntax for creating both Alerts and ActionSheets from UIAlertController
* String together methods to build more complex alerts and action sheets

## Basic Usage

### Alert
``` Swift
Alert(title: "Title", message: "Message")
	.addAction("Cancel")
	.addAction("Delete", style: .Destructive, handler: { _ in
		//Delete the object
	}).show()
```

### Action Sheet
``` Swift
ActionSheet(title: "Title", message: "Message")
	.addAction("Cancel")
	.addAction("Delete", style: .Destructive, handler: { _ in
		//Delete the object
	}).show()
```

## Detailed Usage

There are two seperate classes for creating `UIAlertControllers`, `Alert`, and `ActionSheet`. These are used to simplify the creation of the controller. Both can be initialized with or without both a title and message.

``` Swift
Alert()
ActionSheet()

Alert(title: "My title")
ActionSheet(title: "My title")

Alert(message: "My message")
ActionSheet(message: "My message")

Alert(title: "My title", message: "My message")
ActionSheet(title: "My title", message: "My message")
```

Add various actions to the controller using `addAction`. By default the button will be styled `Cancel`, but this can be configured on a per button basis, along with the handler that is called if the button is clicked. The possible styles are `Cancel`, `Default`, and `Destructive`. These methods can be strung together to add more buttons to the controller.

``` Swift
ActionSheet()
	.addAction("Cancel")
	.addAction("Save", style: .Default) {
		saveTheObject()
	}
	.addAction("Delete", style: Destructive) {
		deleteTheObject()
	}
```

The controller can be presented by calling `show()`. It will be animated by default.

``` Swift
Alert()
	.addAction("Okay")
	.show()
	
ActionSheet()
	.addAction("Delete", style: .Destructive) {
		delete()
	}
	.addAction("Cancel")
	.show(animated: true) {
		controllerWasPresented()
	}
```

### Alert Specific Configuration

There is a shortcut on alerts to show with an okay button: `showOkay`

``` Swift
Alert(title: "Stuff has happened").showOkay()
```

You can also add your own shortcut show method. The following adds a `showNevermind` button that adds a `Nevermind` button and shows the alert.

``` Swift
extension Alert {
	///Shortcut method for adding a nevermind button and showing the alert
	public func showNevermind() {
		addAction("Nevermind", style: .Cancel, preferredAction: false, handler: nil)
		show()
	}
}
```

Text fields can also be added to alerts. To add a text field, initialize a text field first, and configure it, then pass it in with the alert. Note that text fields must be initialized as `var` rather than `let`

``` Swift
var textField = UITextField()
textField.placeholder = "Password"
textField.secureTextEntry = true

Alert().addTextfield(&textField).showOkay()
```

You can also configure the `preferredAction` property on an alert. This will highlight the text of the action, and pressing the return key on a physical keyboard will trigger this action.

``` Swift
Alert()
	.addAction("Okay", style: .Default, preferredAction: true)
	.show()
```

### ActionSheet Specific Configuration

If presenting on iPad, ActionSheets need to be configured with where it is presenting from. This is done by using the `setBarButtonItem` or `setPresentingSource` function. Note that this has no effect on iPhone, so it is safe, and recommended, to call this method if your app supports both iPad and iPhone.

``` Swift
ActionSheet()
	.addAction("Delete", style: .Destructive) {
		delete()
	}
	.addAction("Cancel")
	.setBarButtonItem(navigationController.rightBarButtonItem)
	.show(animated: true) {
		controllerWasPresented()
	}
	
ActionSheet()
	.addAction("Delete", style: .Destructive) {
		delete()
	}
	.addAction("Cancel")
	.setPresentingSource(buttonThatWasPressed)
	.show(animated: true) {
		controllerWasPresented()
	}
```

##Testing

You can add an override for the `show` method to make it easy to add unit tests for your alerts.

``` Swift
func testDeleteOpensConfirmationAlert() {
	let expectation = expectationWithDescription("Show override")

	LKAlertController.overrideShowForTesting { (style, title, message, actions, fields) -> Void in 
		
		XCTAssertEquals(title, "Are you sure you want to delete?", "Alert title was incorrect")
		
		expectation.fulfill()
	}
	
	model.delete()
	
	//If the override is never called, and the expectation is not fulfilled, the test will fail
	waitForExpectations(0.5, handler: nil)
}
```

This will allow you to test the controller was presented as well as the title, message, actions and fields of the alert or action sheet.

## Installation

LKAlertController is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "LKAlertController"
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate LKAlertController into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "lightningkite/LKAlertController"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `LKAlertController.framework` into your Xcode project.
